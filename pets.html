          <h3>Pitbulls and other bully type breeds...</h3>
          <p>
            are often maligned in media, with many misrepresentations
            surrounding them. For one, their jaws do not lock - no dogs jaws are
            capable of that, to be frank. This is just one of several silly
            myths surrounding these loveable cuddle bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for how dangerous they might be, Lily and Riker are two of the
            sweetest bully-type pups you will ever meet. Lily can be bought with
            treats, for one. And, for the record, Riker is terrified of his own
            farts.
