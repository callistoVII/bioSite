          <h2>Kara Kitchen works as a paramedic...</h2>
          <p>
            currently stationed with a county outfit near York, PA. However,
            previous deployments are where she earned the moniker "The Little
            Medic," where this site gets its name. Kara initially started out
            working in retail, which supported her financially as she went
            through the necessary schooling to become a paramedic.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has come a very long way since her retail beginnings, and she
            greatly enjoys her current career standings where she also works to
            train future paramedics, in addition to her regular duties. When
            Kara is not on shift, she can be found either up to her eyebrows in
            fabric and thread, creating sartorial wonders, or up to her elbows
            in dough for her latest baking adventure. Currently, she is
            mastering the art of baking bread.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kara lives in Pennsylvania, with her husband Tom, and her two
            spoiled-silly dogs, Riker and Lily.
