            <h2>Start at the Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              Unlike many others in her field, Kara never started off with the
              intention of becoming a paramedic. In her own words, "It started
              with a boy." In 2009, a newly minted High School graduate the year
              before, Kara looked at her employment options in a floundering
              economy and made a decision. Nursing school had been her original
              plan, but she found it harder to get into than NASA. The Army was
              a non-starter - Kara has a congenital hearing defect and so was
              deemed Not Army Material. Her first serious relationship had just
              ended, so she took a job at a big box store where they wear blue
              polo shirts and sell technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the blue box store, Kara met a new potential romance, inspiring
              her to reconsider her employment options. Something
              recession-proof. Health Care. Nursing was still a non-starter,
              looking more bleak than ever.
            </p>

              After some Googling, comparing the cost of tech schools offering
              CNA classes and EMT classes, Kara did the math on the average
              salary of an EMT to a Nurse and found them comparable. She took a
              calculated leap and enrolled in the EMT course. At the end of the
              course, Kara's instructor encouraged her and a few other students
              to continue to paramedic school. The boy this all started over
              ended up exiting the picture, but Kara had found something more
              worthwhile, and as it turns out, a career.

              These days, Kara Kitchen works as a paramedic stationed with Penn
              State Health, near York, PA. She and her husband lead active
              lives, and when at work, she spends her time answering 9-1-1 calls
              and running scheduled medical transports. She works with multiple
              agencies in a wide variety of settings: rural, city, suburbs,
              farm, and industrial, and she has become an integral member of her
              division.

              As for the Future, Kara has plans to continue baking, and creating
              amazing wearable works of art. In the past year, she and her
              husband bought a new house and are working to make it their home,
              fixing up parts of it that are boring and builder-grade. She was
              also recently recommended to apply for a promotion to sergeant, as
              she would be a great fit for the role.
