          <h3>Welcome to the Home of The Little Medic.</h3>
          <p>
            Kara Kitchen is a full-time Paramedic, and a recent transplant to
            Pennsylvania by way of Florida. She is an auto-didact who taught
            herself how to operate a sewing machine and has since created many
            period accurate articles of clothing more at home in the Civil war
            era than in modern times, and has also sold many custom pieces as
            well. The very definition of "where there's a will, there's a way,"
            she has also figured out how to make actual pleated kilts. All of
            which she sales via her e-commerce storefront housed with Etsy.
          </p>

          <p>
            If that wasn't bonkers enough, Kara also knows her way around a
            kitchen and does amazing things with carbs and fruit filling. Her
            artisanal pies are works of art, in and of themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            When she is not saving lives, or making the rest of us look bad, she
            can be found snuggled up with her two pups, Riker and Lily, reading
            a good book, or off on site-seeing adventures with her husband, Tom.
