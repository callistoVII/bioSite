            This is a website dedicated to the life, times, and hobbies of Kara
            Kitchen. Kara is one of the most amazing human beings I have ever
            had the privilege to know. She is a paramedic, she is a fantastic
            seamstress, and, for the record, she does amazing things with carbs.

            <h3>Quick Facts about Kara:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Kara earned the moniker "The Little Medic" due to her diminutive
                stature.
              </li>
              <li>
                She has traveled to several countries outside of the US,
                including Germany.
              </li>
              <li>
                She's made kilts without a pattern, just from eye-balling the
                finished product.
              </li>
              <li>Sarcasm is her first language.</li>

            This is a website dedicated to the life, times, and hobbies of Kara
            Kitchen. Kara is one of the most amazing human beings I have ever
            had the privilege to know. She is a paramedic, she is a fantastic

          </p>
          <p>
            Due to her tiny stature, Kara earned the nickname "Little Medic" in
            the beginning stages of her career. She has since gone on to make
            that name an ironic one, sort of like Little John from Robinhood,
            only it's her spirit that's mighty. She's been in the medical field
            since 2009, and has traveled the world, with more plans in the
            future to visit other far off places. Besides being talented with
            carbs and threads, she's also very clever with home renovation
            projects.
