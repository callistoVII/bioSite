            <h3>Welcome to the Home of The Little Medic.</h3>
            <p>
              Kara Kitchen is a full-time Paramedic, and a recent transplant to
              Pennsylvania by way of Florida. She is an auto-didact who taught
              herself how to operate a sewing machine and has since created many
              period accurate articles of clothing more at home in the Civil war or Renaissance
              era than in modern times, and has also sold many custom pieces as
              well. The very definition of "where there's a will, there's a way,"
              she has also figured out how to make actual pleated kilts. All of
              which she sales via her e-commerce storefront housed with Etsy.
            </p>

            <p>
              If that wasn't bonkers enough, Kara also knows her way around a
              kitchen and does amazing things with carbs and fruit filling. Her
              artisanal pies are works of art, in and of themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
              When she is not saving lives, or making the rest of us look bad, she
              can be found snuggled up with her two pups, Riker and Lily, reading
              a good book, or off on site-seeing adventures with her husband, Tom.
